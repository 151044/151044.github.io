Dear all students, <br><br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Don't give up</a>. <br><br>

If you want to give up this course, I encourage you. Don't give up. <br>
Pause for a moment and think. If you retake this course, then you may not allow to take other courses in the next semester, especially those courses having <a href="https://github.com/CAG2Mark/UstCoursePlanner">pre-requisite with this course</a>.
Then you may need to defer your graduation. It will definitely <a href="https://selfgardener.com/water-money-tree/">water your parents' money</a>. If they know you will need to defer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy">their hearts will be very sad</a>. <br><br>

I totally understand your parants' feeling because I am also a father with two kids. <br>
Retrospect... , when you were a baby or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_process">child</a>, especially you were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">sick</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance">mother, father</a> took care of you whole night. Do you still <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory">remember</a>? <br><br>

When you were hungry, sad and sorrowful in your childhood, your mother said softly that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(Nineteen_Eighty-Four)">I am always with you....</a><br><br>

My dear children, do not give <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)">up</a>. You all still have chance to <a href="https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/approved-course-grades-undergraduate">pass</a> this course (depending on your performance of final examination).<br><br>
