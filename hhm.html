Dear all students,

Don't give up.

If you want to give up this course, I encourage you. Don't give up.
Pause for a moment and think. If you retake this course, then you may not allow to take other courses in the next semester, especially those courses having pre-requisite with this course.
Then you may need to defer your graduation. It will definitely water your parents' money. If they know you will need to defer, their hears will be very sad.

I totally understand your parants' feeling because I am also a father with two kids.
Retrospect... , when you were a baby or child, especially you were sick, mother, father took care of you whole night. Do you still remember?

When you were hungry, sad and sorrowful in your childhoold, your mother said softly that I am always with you....

My dear children, do not give up. You all still have chance to pass this course (depending on your performance of final examination).

Dr Ho
